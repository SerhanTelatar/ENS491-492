#Supply Chain Decision Analysis
This repository contains datasets and code to analyze decision-making processes between manufacturers and retailers in a simulated supply chain environment. The goal is to explore the impact of participant characteristics and biases on their decisions.

##Project Overview
In this project, a manufacturer and retailer interact over forty periods in a simulated supply chain experiment. The retailer faces the newsvendor problem and decides on order quantities based on contract offers from the manufacturer. Both parties are human participants, whose interactions may be influenced by individual traits and biases. The main objective is to identify correlations between these traits and participants' decision-making using machine learning and regression models.

##Data
The repository includes:

Interaction Data: Detailed datasets of manufacturer-retailer interactions across multiple pairs, capturing decision points, contract offers, and order quantities.
Characteristic Surveys: Survey data capturing the demographic and psychological traits of participants, which may influence decision-making patterns.
